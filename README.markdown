# My Tribute Page
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/iredafeowolabi/pen/rEoYdx](https://codepen.io/iredafeowolabi/pen/rEoYdx).

 I used the story of Abraham Lincoln to create a tribute page. Since my focus was on the code and not the info in the write up, the picture and story line was got from wikipedia and all credits for the information goes to them while credit for the code goes to me.
