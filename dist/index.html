    <p> <h4>  Abraham Lincoln <strong>(February 12, 1809 â€“ April 15, 1865)</strong> was an American statesman, politician, and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the United States from <b>1861</b> until his assassination in April <b>1865</b>. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.</p><br>

<p>Born in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. Self-educated, he became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator and Congressman. He left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of Democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in <b>1854</b>. He became a leader in the new Republican Party and gained national attention in <b>1858</b> for debating national Democratic leader Stephen A. Douglas in the <b>1858</b> Illinois Senate campaign. He then ran for President in <b>1860</b>, sweeping the North and winning. Southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the North was rejecting the constitutional rights of Southern states to practice slavery. They began the process of seceding from the union.</p><br> 
    <p>To secure its independence, the new Confederate States of America fired on Fort Sumter, one of the few U.S. forts in the South. Lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.</p>
